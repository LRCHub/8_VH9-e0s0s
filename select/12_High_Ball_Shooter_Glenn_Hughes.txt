Well I'm a rock'n'roll preacher
Not a Sunday school teacher
You ain't no shady lady
But I love the way you strut your stuff
You're a snow queen looking mean
Tryin' to make it on the scene
I guess you love it
'Cause I always see you hangin' around

You're a Highball Shooter
You make it easy to see
Highball Shooter
You sure ripped the low ones off me

A magnet brought you to me
Told me your name was Jo
You said you liked my music
And you really did enjoy the show
Now I wanna play piano
But my fingers don't agree
They're busy on you woman
And I feel your fingers workin' on me

You're a Highball Shooter
You make it easy to see
Highball shooter
You sure ripped the low ones off me

It's time to leave you honey
I know you're feeling sad
Don't you cry now baby
You know that only makes me mad
I see you everywhere I go
Every town and place
I can't recall your name
But I know I won't forget your sweet face

You're a Highball shooter
You make it easy to see
Highball shooter
You sure ripped the low ones off me
'Cause you're a Highball shooter
You make it easy to see
Highball shooter
You sure ripped the low ones off me
